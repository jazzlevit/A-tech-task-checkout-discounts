Our supermarket's quest for global reach has prompted us to open a new supermarket - we sell only three products:
 
Product code | Name         | Price
-----------------------------------------
FR1          | Fruit tea    |  £3.11
SR1          | Strawberries |  £5.00
CF1          | Coffee       | £11.23

The CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers and of fruit tea. He wants us to add a rule to do this.
 
The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a price discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to £4.50
 
Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because the CEO and COO change their minds often, it needs to be flexible regarding our pricing rules.
 
The interface to our checkout looks like this (shown in PHP):
 
 $co = new Checkout($pricing_rules);
 $co->scan($item);
 $co->scan($item);
 $price = $co->total;
 
1 - Implement a checkout system that fulfils these requirements.
2 - Make sure your code is fully documented so that PHPDoc files can be generated automatically.
3 - Make sure your code is 100% covered by unit tests.
